# Cimetidine-Midazolam-DDI
Cimetidine-Midazolam-DDI simulations were published by Hanke et al. [1].

Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot file containing simulations of published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Cimetidine-Midazolam-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.
